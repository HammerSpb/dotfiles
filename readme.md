# Dotfiles

Public repository for my personal dotfiles.

Based on  [Holman dotfiles](github.com/holman/dotfiles)

## What Is This?

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything which is needed to install my preffered setup of OS X is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy! :smile:

## A Fresh OS X Setup

Follow these install instructions to setup a new OS X system.

1. Update OS X to the latest version with the App Store
2. Setup OS X with [these preferences](./osx/readme.md)
3. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
4. Install OS X Command Line Tools

## Thanks To...

I first got the idea for starting this project by visiting the [Github does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) project. Both [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) were great sources of inspiration. Also, [Sourabh Bajaj](https://twitter.com/sb2nov/)'s [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/) proved to be invaluable. In general, I'd like to thank every single one who open-sources their dotfiles for their effort to contribute something to the open-source community. Your work means the world. :earth_africa: :heart:
